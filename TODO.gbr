Document minibuffer bindings in mg.1

Maybe split out a set-default-tab-width.  (That's currently the effect
if you run it with an argument.)  Neither it nor `set-tab-width` are in
GNU Emacs.

auto-execute assignments can't be listed
auto-execute assignments can't be removed

rename undo-list to list-undo (GNU Emacs has neither), to align with
other list-* commands

apropos doesn't list duplicate bindings.  Could use ditto mark (") for
this?

Ordering of commands in apropos help is not obvious.

Add an insert-byte command accepting octal input.

Use set-prompt-delay in an inverse sense to collect a keystroke
_sequence_ from define-key and describe-key-briefly (that is, they
assume the sequence is done when the delay elapses).  May require adding
logic to report an ambiguous prefix.

Want C-h in minibuffer for `quickhelp`; save minibuffer contents,
replace it with 1 line (< 80 columns) if help, and await C-h to pop
back.

rename eval-current-buffer -> eval-buffer [GNU Emacs]

implement eval-region? [GNU Emacs]

Should I-search remember last search?
