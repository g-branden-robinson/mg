Document minibuffer bindings in mg.1

Better distinguish modes from what we can call "settings".

Modes are generally more complex, and their enablement is presented on
the modeline.

Settings are simple Boolean or integer values, and are not reported in
the modeline.  However, we can make their toggling/setting commands
report their (new) value in the minibuffer once they complete.
set-fill-column already works this way.

Thus, report outcome of toggle operations in minibuffer.

                                                                   done?
List of settings:
	audible-bell [not in GNU Emacs]
	backup-to-home-directory [not in GNU Emacs]
	bsmap-mode [sic] [not in GNU Emacs]
	leave-tmpdir-backups [not in GNU Emacs]
	make-backup-files [not in GNU Emacs]
	set-fill-column
	meta-key-mode [sic] [not in GNU Emacs]
	set-prompt-delay [not in GNU Emacs]                          *
	sentence-end-double-space [not in GNU Emacs]
	toggle-read-only-all [not in GNU Emacs; "global" (sort of)]
	visible-bell [not in GNU Emacs]

List of modes:
	auto-fill-mode
	auto-indent-mode
	column-number-mode
	global-wd-mode
	line-number-mode
	no-tab-mode
	overwrite-mode
	c-mode

You can't set _all_ of the foregoing modes proper; you get a "Too many
modes" error.  The limit is 2 fewer than it could be.  Fix it.

Other:
	toggle-read-only [buffer-specific flag]
	set-tab-width [not in GNU Emacs; both global & buffer-specific]

Maybe split out a set-default-tab-width.  (That's currently the effect
if you run it with an argument.)

auto-execute assignments can't be listed
auto-execute assignments can't be removed

rename undo-list to list-undo (GNU Emacs has neither), to align with
other list-* commands

apropos doesn't list duplicate bindings.  Could use ditto mark (") for
this?

Ordering of commands in apropos help is not obvious.

Add an insert-byte command accepting octal input.

Use set-prompt-delay in an inverse sense to collect a keystroke
_sequence_ from define-key and describe-key-briefly (that is, they
assume the sequence is done when the delay elapses).  May require adding
logic to report an ambiguous prefix.

Stop using strtonum() for range checks in command handlers.  A parameter
bypasses the check with no diagnostic.

Want C-h in minibuffer for `quickhelp`; save minibuffer contents,
replace it with 1 line (< 80 columns) if help, and await C-h to pop
back.

rename eval-current-buffer -> eval-buffer [GNU Emacs]

implement eval-region? [GNU Emacs]

Should I-search remember last search?
